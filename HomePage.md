This wiki is a kind of diary describing my work during my internship in the third year bachelor.
Far from showing only the "good" side of my work, it reveals my hesitations, my repentance, and how I led this project from scratch.
At the beginning of this internship I have absolutely no knowledge about Java, distributed systems and so on. It is therefore a total discovery.

Let's go !
