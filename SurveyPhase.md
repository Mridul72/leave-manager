# Daily Shedule #

## beginning of the internship, project survey phase : ##

  * **02/05** :
    * Partial state of the art of leave management software (open source) :
      * http://sourceforge.net/projects/staffhols/ : PHP / mySQL, too bad for anything to be learned :(
      * http://gestperso.tuxfamily.org/presentation.html : PHP / mySQL, no management rights, not user / administrator mode... uninteresting :(
      * http://www.ced.univ-montp2.fr/php_conges/index.html : PHP / mySQL, three levels of rights, automatic intall, multilingual interface.
    * Creation of a google doc file shared with Yohan to list all the features and "pages" that the average user or admin will see : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRqjeBjUFyaSdBgHrveFY4OPJVFmEe7dZnTTOSKTjko/edit

  * **06/05** : **Third project meeting**
    * Common reading of the document listing the features expected of the program : Yohan answers to my questions on the different levels of access required, the restriction of the rights of users and features that do not correspond to the reality of French companies.
    * Yohan explanations on security risks and how to protect data (password) that allow access to the database.
    * **TODO** :
      * **Specify the information necessary for the definition of "types of leave" and how to handle its data**.
      * **Investigate how a director of Human Resources calculates the acquisition of days off according to time worked**.
      * **Complete list of functionality of the program**.
      * **Start writing the specifications**.

  * **07/05** :
    * Moving of the wiki to Google Code : the wiki plugin for Eclipse proves to be impractical to use.

  * **11/05** :
    * Completion of the plan software (to provide views and functions)
    * Roughing the Conceptual Data Model

  * **12/05** :
    * The software used for Merise CDM proves to be incomplete : impossible to create reflexive relationship or parent-child relation
    * Research of another software to realize the CDM : choice of JMerise (http://www.jfreesoft.com/JMerise/index.html)

  * **13/05** :
    * Completion of the ["features list"](ExpectedFeatures.md) and CDM and creation of a list of the questions raised.
    * Preparation of the specifications skeleton : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ehtoczhoM-M3qU7-yyC7X7KfUc2Xz4YPiXyqi5NjCU/edit

  * **17/05** : **Fourth project meeting**
    * Discution on the choice of features to develop in order to finalize the conceptual data model
    * Discution on the specifications goals
    * **TODO** :
      * **Writing the specifications**.
      * **Settle definitively the structure of the database**
      * **Start thinking about implementation**

  * **18/05** :
