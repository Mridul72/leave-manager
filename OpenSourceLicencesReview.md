# important concepts #
## Open-source ##
Open source software allows access to sources, he gives the right to know how it works. But an open-source software is not necessarily free (in the sense of freedom).
## Libre ##
Free software (in the sense of freedom) can be freely used, studied (ie open source), amended and its duplication to be broadcast is technically and legally permissible.
## Copyleft ##
Copyleft software is free software for which any redistribution to the same or modified must be done while preserving the same conditions: the work of an author can not evolve into a restriction of rights of use, access to source, modification or distribution. Therefore, softwaremade ​​from copyleft components, can only be copyleft.

Open-source, free (in the sense of freedom) and copyleft, do not involve free (in the monetary sense).

# Copyleft free licenses #
## GNU-GPL, GNU General Public licence ##
### GPL v.1 : ###
This license guarantees:
  * The freedom to run the software for any purpose;
  * The freedom to study how a program works and adapt it to their needs, which requires access to source code;
  * The freedom to redistribute copies;
  * The freedom to benefit the community of modified versions.
This license has a copyleft clause: If a work contains an GPL element it must be fully GPL.

### GPL v.2 : ###
The main new feature of version 2 is the clause called "liberty or death" (section 7 of the GPL), which states that the obligations imposed by court decisions or allegations of patent infringement do not relieve users of the conditions of the license. If the obligations of justice and those of the GPL are not compatible then the distribution of the program should be discontinued.

### GPL v.3 ###
The goal of GPLv3 is to protect against "Tivoization" in English, as the term coined by RMS "circumvention of the spirit of the legal obligations of a free license, particularly the GPL, by technical means." The company has used TiVo GPLed software in its digital video recorders but made ​​sure that no modified version will run with his material, making the program modification technically impossible.

GPLv3 also protects against the threat of patent agreements like the Novell-Microsoft pact that was supposed to allow Microsoft to use its thousands of patents to make users pay for the privilege of running GNU / Linux, while providing a rather limited protection to Novell's customers against Microsoft patents. This agreement contains some flaws that GPLv3 has used to turn them against Microsoft.

## GNU-AGPL, Affero General Public License v.3 ##
Based on the GNU-GPL, it has an additional term to allow users who interact with the licensed software over a network to receive the source of this program.
This license is recommended for all software running on a network.
**The GNU AGPL is not compatible with GPLv2 and GPLv3**: you can not transmit or modify the code under GNU AGPL under the terms of GPLv3, or vice versa. However, it is possible to combine modules or separate source files, released under both licenses at once, in one project, which will give many programmers all the permission they need to make the programs they want.

## GNU-GFDL, GNU Free Documentation License ##
Form of copyleft intended for manuals, textbooks and other materials.
Effective opportunity to freely copy and redistribute the document with or without modifications, and whether or not for commercial purposes.

## GNU All-Permissive License ##
Compatible with the GNU-GPL, it is recommended for the README files and other small files using GNU packages.

## Licence CeCILL ##
This license was created by French research organizations: CEA (Atomic Energy Commission), CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research) and INRIA (National Institute Research in Computer science and Automatic).

It helps to ensure that creators and users of free software respect French law (tort law and intellectual property) and ensure compliance with the principles of free software.
It clarifies certain concepts such as acceptance of the license (described as a contract) that begins on the date of downloading the software by the user, and the rights to sell services.

This license is copyleft but to maintain compatibility with the GNU-GPL, it provides that if software includes code governed by the GPL then the GPL applies.

**The license CeCILL-B** is fully compatible with the BSD style licenses (BSD, X11, ...) that have a strong obligation quotation (which goes beyond a simple copyright notice).

**CeCILL-C**, for "component", is fully compatible with the GNU LGPL by the FSF.

# Free Licenses #
## GNU-LGPL, GNU Lesser General Public License and oldest GNU Library General Public License ##
Very similar to the GPL, this limited license, or diminished, was created to allow some free software to spread in areas where a publication is not entirely free. This license applies to libraries, but often the word "librairy" was abandoned because it was misleading some developers who were unaware of the limitation in copyleft of this license.

A work containing a LGPL element is not necessarily LGPL.

## BSD, Berkeley Software Distribution license, "four clauses BSD license" ##
This license allows you to reuse all or part of a software without restriction, it is integrated into an open source or proprietary.
The original version of the BSD license **includes a particularly restrictive advertising clause that requires** the copyright notice in any advertising or materials provided with the software.

The BSD license is one of the least restrictive in the computer world and approaching the notion of "public domain" except that it defines a clear framework for using, it imposes certain restrictions on redistribution, it allows protect authors regarding the use of their name in derivatives and discharge the authors of known and unknown potential problems associated with the use of the code.

## New BSD license or Modified BSD license "BSD license with three clauses" ##
The very restrictive advertising clause was removed.

## X11 license (MIT) ##
This is a free software license, not copyleft, very close to modified BSD license, only the last clause differs.

The license gives anyone receiving the software unlimited right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sell and change its license. The only obligation is to put the authors' names with the copyright notice.


## The FreeBSD license, "two clauses BSD license" ##
This is a free software license simple, permissive non copyleft, compatible with the GNU GPL.

This is the original BSD license whose advertising clause and another clause had been deleted. A comment stating that "the views and conclusions contained in the software and documentation are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing official policies, either expressed or implied, of the FreeBSD Project" was added.

## Clear BSD License ##
This is a free software license, compatible with GPLv2 and GPLv3. It is based on the modified BSD license, and adds a term expressly stating it does not grant any patent license. The use of code under this license may be risky if the author decides to sue you for patent infringement.

## Apache License ##
Key features of the Apache license are, firstly, to allow modification and distribution of code in any form (free or proprietary, free or commercial) and, secondly, to require the retention of copyright when editing (and also the text of the license itself).

## Artistic License ##
Artistic License (Perl Artistic License sometimes called) is the software license used by the Perl programming language, together with the GNU General Public License. This license is not copyleft.

## CC0 license ##
CC0 license is used to make available content that can be reused freely, improved, changed, whatever the purpose and without restriction of right except those imposed by law.

CC0 license gives the possibility of abandoning its copyright in the limit of what is required by law in all jurisdictions. This license is similar to other free licenses such as BSD. In some countries, the total abandonment of copyright is not possible, the license provided the means to contribute to the public domain regardless of the country concerned.

Unlike other Creative Commons licenses and GNU GPL or BSD, there is no additional restrictions : no obligation to cite the author (unless the law of the country requires it, it is for example the case in France) or to redistribute / modify the work under the same license.



## OSL, Open Software License ##
The Open Software License is a free software license, which is incompatible with the GNU GPL in several ways.

Recent versions of the Open Software License have a clause that requires from the distributors to try to get an explicit authorization of the author. This implies that distribute such software on an FTP site, release patches or store the software in a version control system is a violation of the license. In fact, it is very difficult to develop software licensed OSL with the usual tools used for free software.
